# PixelWise: Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Classification
In our endeavor, we are tackling the challenge of classifying handwritten digits present in the MNIST dataset. Our objective is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of accurately identifying and categorizing these handwritten numbers. This entails providing the algorithm with a handwritten digit as input and enabling it to successfully determine the corresponding numerical value. Focusing on the MNIST dataset, we are determined to harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) to push the boundaries of accuracy and efficiency.

# MNIST DATASET
The MNIST dataset, a staple in machine learning, encompasses 70,000 handwritten digit images, partitioned into a training set with 60,000 samples and a test set with 10,000. It is compiled from a diverse group that includes U.S. Census Bureau employees and students from high schools. Each image is uniformly sized to fit within a 28x28 pixel frame, centrally placed to maintain aspect ratio inside a 20x20 pixel area. This normalization process, along with anti-aliasing techniques, accounts for the varying grey shades observed in the images.

As a fundamental resource in the machine learning domain, the MNIST database serves as a primary testing ground for novel computer vision algorithms, providing a benchmark to assess the efficacy of emerging models, especially those designed for digit recognition.

Utilizing TensorFlow, the MNIST dataset is conveniently pre-divided into training and testing subsets:
- The training set includes 60,000 images, complete with labels, to facilitate model training.
- The testing set comprises 10,000 labeled images, which are used to measure the model's accuracy post-training.

# Understanding Image Classification
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves categorizing images into predefined classes or labels. In today's digital era, this capability finds widespread applications across various domains. One such application is the recognition of handwritten digits, a cornerstone task in fields ranging from digit recognition in postal services to automated form processing in finance and healthcare.

# The Role of CNNs and ViT
Both CNNs and ViT offer distinct advantages in addressing the challenges of image classification. CNNs, with their hierarchical structure and ability to capture spatial information through convolutional layers, have long been the go-to choice for tasks like this. Their success lies in their ability to automatically learn features from the data, making them particularly effective for tasks where the input data has a grid-like topology, such as images.On the other hand, Vision Transformers have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies in images without relying on convolutional operations. This allows ViT to effectively model long-range interactions, making them particularly suited for tasks where global context is crucial, such as understanding relationships between different parts of an image.
